<center>The Angelus Prayer</center>
<table BORDER >

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>The <i>Angelus</i> prayer is a traditional devotion
used morning, noon, and evening in honor of the Incarnation of our Lord
Jesus Christ.&nbsp; It is also appropriate before or after Holy Mass.&nbsp;
The devotion gets its name from the first word of the prayer in Latin.
<p>From Easter Day through the day of Pentecost, the <i><a href="linkpage3.html">Regina
Coeli</a></i> is used instead of the <i>Angelus.</i>

<br>The angel of the Lord declared unto Mary
<br>And she conceived by the Holy Spirit.
<p>Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee
<br>Blessed art thou among women,
<br>and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.
<br>Holy Mary, Mother of God,&nbsp;
<br>Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of
our death.&nbsp; Amen.
<p>Behold the handmaid of the Lord
<br>Be it done unto me according to thy word.
<p>Hail Mary full of grace, ...
<br>Holy Mary, Mother of God,...
<p>And the WORD was made flesh
<br>And dwelt among us.
<p>Hail Mary full of grace, ...
<br>Holy Mary, Mother of God,...
<p>Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God
<br>That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.
<p>Pour your grace into our hearts, O Lord, that we who have
<br>known the incarnation of your Son Jesus Christ, announced
<br>by an angel to the Virgin Mary, may by his cross and passion
<br>be brought to the glory of his resurrection; who lives and
<br>reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now
<br>and for ever.&nbsp; <i>Amen</i>

</CENTER>
</font><P><font size="4">O St. Joseph whose protection is so great, so strong, so prompt before the Throne of God, I place in you all my interests and desires.  O St. Joseph do assist me by your powerful intercession and obtain for me from your Divine Son all spiritual blessings through Jesus Christ, Our Lord; so that having engaged here below your Heavenly power I may offer my Thanksgiving and Homage to the most Loving of Fathers.  O St. Joseph, I never weary contemplating you and Jesus asleep in your arms.  I dare not approach while He reposes near your heart.  Press him in my name and kiss His fine Head for me, and ask Him to return the Kiss when I draw my dying breath.  St. Joseph, Patron of departing souls, pray for us.  Amen

<i>Say for nine consecutive mornings for anything you may desire.  It has seldom been known to fail.</i>

<P>This prayer was found in the fiftieth year of Our Lord Jesus Christ.  In 1500's it was sent by the Pope to Emperor Charles when he was going into battle.
<P>Whoever reads this prayer or hears it or carries it, will never die a sudden death, nor be drowned, nor will poison take effect on them.  They will not fall into the hands of the enemy nor be burned in any fire, nor will they be defeated in battle.
